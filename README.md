## Simple yet pretty React PWA Weather App

Made this with ReactJS and CSS. Its layout is sharp and minimalistic, yet displays some pretty background imagery, that portrays the current weather condition.
It is a geolocation based weather app, which gives three days of weather forecast.
As this app is a PWA it can be downloaded to your device. Hope you like it.
This is totally opensource, change as you please! Have fun.
